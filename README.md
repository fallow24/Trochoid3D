# Trochoid3D

This will be used as a motion model for spherical mobile mapping systems.
The model (currently) assumes gravity in -z direction.
Also, the model assumes movement due to rolling without slip in the xy-plane.
In the future, the normal vector of the ground plane w.r.t. gravity will be considered.

# Trochoid3D

This will be used as a motion model for spherical mobile mapping systems.
Also, the model assumes movement due to rolling without slip in arbitrary planes.
The ground normal at any time is considered as rotation around that normal will not lead to translation of the balls center.

Github won't render my math correclty so here's a screenshot.
See README.md.old for the LaTeX code.
